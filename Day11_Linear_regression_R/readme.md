Linear Regression in R

Focus was on moving from exploratory analysis
to building and evaluating predictive models.

I worked on:
• Train/test splits for proper model evaluation
• Handling factor variables in regression
• Understanding R² vs RMSE vs residuals
• Generating and validating predictions
• Combining model results across periods
