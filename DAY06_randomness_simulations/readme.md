#DAY06
This project explores randomness, simulation, and visualization using Python and NumPy by building a random walk model from scratch.

📌 What this project covers

Using np.random.seed() for reproducible results

Generating random numbers with rand() and randint()

Simulating dice rolls using conditional logic

Building a random walk step by step

Running multiple simulations (from a few walks to 500+ walks)

Converting Python lists to NumPy arrays and using array transposition

Visualizing simulations using line plots and histograms

Analyzing the distribution of final positions (Monte Carlo simulation)

#Key takeaway 💡

Repetition + visualization helps make sense of uncertainty.
Small building blocks like loops, conditionals, and random number generation can be combined to simulate complex real-world behavior.
