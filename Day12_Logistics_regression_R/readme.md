# Day 12 — Music Popularity Prediction with Logistic Regression (R)

This project focuses on predicting whether a song will reach the Top 10
using musical attributes and logistic regression in R.
The work is based on an assignment from The Analytics Edge (MIT OpenCourseWare).

## What I Worked On

- Framed song popularity as a binary classification problem
- Built logistic regression models using time-based train/test splits
- Interpreted coefficients and p-values to assess variable importance
- Detected and handled multicollinearity between predictors
- Compared models using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
- Evaluated model performance against a baseline model

## Key Insight

Model performance depends on the decision goal.
In this case, prioritizing high confidence predictions (specificity)
was more valuable than predicting every possible hit.
