# Problem 1.1 - Loading and Summarizing the Dataset
## Load the dataset from CPSData.csv into a data frame called CPS, and view the 
## dataset with the summary() and str() commands.
## Q.1.1: How many interviewees are in the dataset?
str(CPS)
## 131302


# Problem 1.2 - Loading and Summarizing the Dataset
## Q.1.2. Among the interviewees with a value reported for the Industry 
## variable, what is the most common industry of employment? Please enter the 
## name exactly how you see it.

# Problem 1.3 - Loading and Summarizing the Dataset
## Recall from the homework assignment "The Analytical Detective" that you can 
## call the sort() function on the output of the table() function to obtain a 
## sorted breakdown of a variable. For instance, sort(table(CPS$Region)) sorts 
## the regions by the number of interviewees from that region.

## Q.1.3a. Which state has the fewest interviewees?
sort(table(CPS$State))
## New Mexico

## Q.1.3b.Which state has the largest number of interviewees?   
## California


# Problem 1.4 - Loading and Summarizing the Dataset
## Q.1.4. What proportion of interviewees are citizens of the United States?
str(CPS)
table(CPS$Citizenship)
(116639 + 7073) / (116639 + 7073 + 7590)

# Problem 1.5 - Loading and Summarizing the Dataset
## The CPS differentiates between race (with possible values American Indian, 
## Asian, Black, Pacific Islander, White, or Multiracial) and ethnicity. A 
## number of interviewees are of Hispanic ethnicity, as captured by the Hispanic
## variable. 
## Q.1.5. For which races are there at least 250 interviewees in the CPS dataset 
## of Hispanic ethnicity? (Select all that apply.)
table(CPS$Race)
table(CPS$Hispanic)
table(CPS$Race, CPS$Hispanic)
##   American Indian, Black, Multiracial, White


# Problem 2.1 - Evaluating Missing Values
## Q.2.1. Which variables have at least one interviewee with a missing (NA) 
## value? (Select all that apply.)
summary(CPS)
## MetroAreaCode, Married, Education, EmploymentStatus, Industry


# Problem 2.2 - Evaluating Missing Values
## Often when evaluating a new dataset, we try to identify if there is a pattern 
## in the missing values in the dataset. We will try to determine if there is a 
## pattern in the missing values of the Married variable. The function 
is.na(CPS$Married) 
## returns a vector of TRUE/FALSE values for whether the Married variable is 
## missing. We can see the breakdown of whether Married is missing based on the 
## reported value of the Region variable with the function 
table(CPS$Region, is.na(CPS$Married))
## Q.2.2. Which is the most accurate:
table(CPS$Sex, is.na(CPS$Married))
table(CPS$Age, is.na(CPS$Married))
table(CPS$Citizenship, is.na(CPS$Married))

## The Married variable being missing is related to the Age value for the 
## interviewee.


# Problem 2.3 - Evaluating Missing Values
## As mentioned in the variable descriptions, MetroAreaCode is missing if an 
## interviewee does not live in a metropolitan area. Using the same technique as 
## in the previous question, answer the following questions about people who 
## live in non-metropolitan areas.

## Q.2.3a. How many states had all interviewees living in a non-metropolitan 
## area (aka they have a missing MetroAreaCode value)? For this question, treat 
## the District of Columbia as a state (even though it is not technically a 
## state).
summary(CPS$MetroAreaCode)
table(CPS$State, is.na(CPS$MetroAreaCode))
## Alaska, Wyoming = 2

## Q.2.3b. How many states had all interviewees living in a metropolitan area? 
## Again, treat the District of Columbia as a state.
## District of Columbia, New Jersey, Rhode Island = 3


# Problem 2.4 - Evaluating Missing Values
## Q.2.4. Which region of the United States has the largest proportion of 
## interviewees living in a non-metropolitan area?
table(CPS$Region, is.na(CPS$MetroAreaCode))
10674 / (20010 + 10674) ##Midwest = 0.3478686 => Largest proportion
5609 / (20330 + 5609) ##Northeast = 0.2162381
9871 / (31631 + 9871) ##South = 0.237844
8084 / (25093 + 8084) ##West = 0.2436628


# Problem 2.5 - Evaluating Missing Values
## While we were able to use the table() command to compute the proportion of 
## interviewees from each region not living in a metropolitan area, it was 
## somewhat tedious (it involved manually computing the proportion for each 
## region) and isn't something you would want to do if there were a larger 
## number of options. It turns out there is a less tedious way to compute the 
## proportion of values that are TRUE. The mean() function, which takes the 
## average of the values passed to it, will treat TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, 
## meaning it returns the proportion of values that are true. For instance, 
mean(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)) 
## returns 0.75. Knowing this, use tapply() with the mean function to answer 
## the following questions:

## Q.2.5a. Which state has a proportion of interviewees living in a 
## non-metropolitan area closest to 30%?
sort(tapply(is.na(CPS$MetroAreaCode), CPS$State, mean))
## Wisconsin

## Q.2.5b. Which state has the largest proportion of non-metropolitan 
## interviewees, ignoring states where all interviewees were non-metropolitan?
## Montana


# Problem 3.1 - Integrating Metropolitan Area Data
## Codes like MetroAreaCode and CountryOfBirthCode are a compact way to encode 
## factor variables with text as their possible values, and they are therefore 
## quite common in survey datasets. In fact, all but one of the variables in 
## this dataset were actually stored by a numeric code in the original CPS 
## datafile.
## When analyzing a variable stored by a numeric code, we will often want to 
## convert it into the values the codes represent. To do this, we will use a 
## dictionary, which maps the the code to the actual value of the variable. We 
## have provided dictionaries MetroAreaCodes.csv and CountryCodes.csv, which 
## respectively map MetroAreaCode and CountryOfBirthCode into their true values. 
## Read these two dictionaries into data frames MetroAreaMap and CountryMap.
MetroAreaMap <- read.csv("./data_unit1_3/MetroAreaCodes.csv")
CountryMap <- read.csv("./data_unit1_3/CountryCodes.csv")

## Q.3.1a. How many observations (codes for metropolitan areas) are there in 
## MetroAreaMap?
str(MetroAreaMap)
## 271

## Q.3.1b. How many observations (codes for countries) are there in CountryMap?
str(CountryMap)
## 149


# Problem 3.2 - Integrating Metropolitan Area Data
## To merge in the metropolitan areas, we want to connect the field 
## MetroAreaCode from the CPS data frame with the field Code in MetroAreaMap. 
## The following command merges the two data frames on these columns, 
## overwriting the CPS data frame with the result:
CPS = merge(CPS, MetroAreaMap, by.x="MetroAreaCode", by.y="Code", all.x=TRUE)
## The first two arguments determine the data frames to be merged (they are 
## called "x" and "y", respectively, in the subsequent parameters to the merge 
## function). by.x="MetroAreaCode" means we're matching on the MetroAreaCode 
## variable from the "x" data frame (CPS), while by.y="Code" means we're 
## matching on the Code variable from the "y" data frame (MetroAreaMap). 
## Finally, all.x=TRUE means we want to keep all rows from the "x" data frame 
## (CPS), even if some of the rows' MetroAreaCode doesn't match any codes in 
## MetroAreaMap (for those familiar with database terminology, this parameter 
## makes the operation a left outer join instead of an inner join).

## Q.3.2a. Review the new version of the CPS data frame with the summary() and 
## str() functions. What is the name of the variable that was added to the data 
## frame by the merge() operation?
summary(CPS)
str(CPS)
## MetroArea

## Q.3.2b. How many interviewees have a missing value for the new metropolitan 
## area variable? Note that all of these interviewees would have been removed 
## from the merged data frame if we did not include the all.x=TRUE parameter.

## here.

# Problem 3.5 - Integrating Metropolitan Area Data
## Q.3.5. Remembering that CPS$Race == "Asian" returns a TRUE/FALSE vector of 
## whether an interviewee is Asian, determine the number of metropolitan areas 
## in the United States from which at least 20% of interviewees are Asian.
sort(tapply(CPS$Race == "Asian", CPS$MetroArea, mean))
## 4


# Problem 3.6 - Integrating Metropolitan Area Data
## Normally, we would look at the sorted proportion of interviewees from each 
## metropolitan area who have not received a high school diploma with the 
## command:
sort(tapply(CPS$Education == "No high school diploma", CPS$MetroArea, mean))
## However, none of the interviewees aged 14 and younger have an education value 
## reported, so the mean value is reported as NA for each metropolitan area. 
## To get mean (and related functions, like sum) to ignore missing values, you 
## can pass the parameter na.rm=TRUE. 

## Q.3.6. Passing na.rm=TRUE to the tapply function, determine which 
## metropolitan area has the smallest proportion of interviewees who have 
## received no high school diploma.
sort(tapply(CPS$Education == "No high school diploma", 
            CPS$MetroArea,

     decreasing = TRUE)
## Iowa City, IA


# Problem 4.1 - Integrating Country of Birth Data
## Just as we did with the metropolitan area information, merge in the country 
## of birth information from the CountryMap data frame, replacing the CPS data 
## frame with the result. If you accidentally overwrite CPS with the wrong 
## values, remember that you can restore it by re-loading the data frame from 
## CPSData.csv and then merging in the metropolitan area information using the 
## command provided in the previous subproblem.
