This commit contains my R-based analysis of the Current Population Survey
(CPS) dataset as part of The Analytics Edge course (MIT OpenCourseWare).

The work focuses on:
- Exploratory data analysis of demographic and employment variables
- Identifying and interpreting missing data patterns
- Grouped analysis using proportions and summary statistics
- Integrating external lookup tables via merge operations

Questions & datasets are included for learning and reference.
