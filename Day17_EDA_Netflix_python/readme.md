Today I worked on a project from DataCamp, named "Investigating Netflix Films",
where I have done some exploratory analysis on data and learned about the mode() function,
which extracts the most frequent occurring value from the dataset and if there are more than one mode value
the function returns the output as a Series.

I have implemented the questions in datacamp, since the dataset is not available explicitly,
I made my own dataset from the columns mentioned in the project, first by creating a dictionary using key-value pairs
and then converting them into a dataframe using pandas in jupyter notebook. 

Here is the link where you can find the project in Datacamp:
