Day 15 — Decision Trees & Random Forests (R)

• CART (Classification and Regression Trees)
  - Rule-based, non-parametric models
  - Easy to interpret and visualize
  - High variance → prone to overfitting

• Random Forests
  - Ensemble of many CART trees
  - Uses bootstrapped samples and random feature selection
  - Reduces variance and improves out-of-sample performance
  - Less interpretable than a single tree

• Model behavior insights
  - Trees help explain data structure
  - Forests prioritize prediction stability
  - Accuracy alone is not sufficient for evaluation

📊 Model evaluation
• Confusion Matrix
• Sensitivity & Specificity
• ROC Curves
• Comparison between single trees and ensembles

🛠 Tools & Libraries
• rpart
• rpart.plot
• randomForest
• ROCR
• caret
