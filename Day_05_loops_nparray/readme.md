# Day 5 – Loops & Iteration in Python

## Objective
Apply looping constructs to iterate over Python data structures
commonly used in analytics, including pandas DataFrames and NumPy arrays.

## What I Practiced
- Looping over DataFrames using iterrows()
- Accessing index labels and row values
- Adding new columns using loop-based logic
- Using vectorized alternatives with apply()
- Iterating over NumPy arrays and multidimensional data

## Key Takeaway
Loops are foundational for understanding data transformations, while
vectorized operations offer better performance in real-world analytics.
